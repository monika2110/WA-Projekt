		<h2>New ways to reach customers: urban sales formats are catching on</h2>
		<p class="description">With facilities right in the hustle and bustle of inner-city life, Porsche is increasingly turning to urban formats for its retail activities.</p>
		<p>Six Porsche Studios and 11 temporary Porsche NOW sales pop-ups were opened by the sports car manufacturer around the globe during 2021 an average of more than one new site per month. The concept behind the Future Retail sites was also refined over the course of the year, with them now following the Destination Porsche approach. This ensures a particularly inviting atmosphere that's similar to a boutique, digital applications for a new, complete customer experience and much more.</p>
		<p>In total, 17 Porsche Studios and more than 20 Porsche NOW sales pop-ups have been set up in 23 countries to date, creating new points of contact with the brand. And the network is set to become even bigger, with current plans to have overall more than 25 Porsche Studios in high-footfall top city locations by 2023. One example of this will be the opening of a Porsche Studio in Portland, in the US state of Oregon, in spring 2022 the first in North America.</p>
		<p>"With the urban sales formats, we have sought and found new ways to reach customers," says Marco Kana, Director Sales Retail at Porsche. "Whether it is a Porsche Studio or one of our Porsche NOW sales pop-ups, these innovative formats offer easy access to the brand and are ideally suited to developing contact opportunities with new target groups. We will continue to develop these innovative retail formats over the coming years."</p>
		<p>As part of its Future Retail strategy, Porsche is aiming to reach out to new, younger target groups, as well as its existing customers. The basic idea behind this is to bring the product offering to the customers and not the other way around. With the trend towards urbanisation, city centres are becoming more and more important. But these two sales concepts are not the only strategy Porsche is using to generate greater customer proximity; the same can be said of its new Porsche Satellite Centre, Porsche Approved & Service Centre and Porsche Service Factory.</p>
