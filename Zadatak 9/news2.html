			<h2>Exploring the Timmelsjoch High Alpine Road</h2>
			<p class="description">The Timmelsjoch is not the fastest route over the Alpine divide – but it’s certainly one of the most beautiful: a road that’s a pleasure to drive, inviting travellers to stop along the way.</p>
			<p>A mountain pass is always a promise as well: of journeys and discoveries, of exchange and trade. Mountain passes cross boundaries. And every now and then they also enable a journey through time, connecting the past with the present as they shape the history of individual families and entire regions. All this and more is represented by the High Alpine Road over the 2,509-metre Timmelsjoch between the Otztal and Passeier valleys, between Tyrol and South Tyrol, on the Austria/Italy border.</p>
			<p>Alban Scheiber brakes into the next bend with the Porsche Taycan, sets up an elegant line on the inner edge of the road, and accelerates onto the ascending straight. He is at one with every inch of this ribbon of asphalt and the torque of the electric sports car. His twin brother Attila sits relaxed in the passenger seat, letting his gaze wander over the sweeping fields of snow. A ptarmigan (a type of game bird) observes the scene. Nothing disturbs the silence of the moment. </p>
