    <p>Porsche is the most successful manufacturer of exclusive sports cars and has an outstanding reputation. This success is based on the desirability of the vehicles, but equally importantly, due to its unique corporate culture that is shaped by integrity and compliance. And it should stay that way. All board members, members of the management bodies, managers and employees make their own contributions every day according to the motto:
        Sporty and fair - that's typical Porsche.</p>
    <p>Porsche stands for strong values such as fairness, responsibility, mutual respect and trust, transparency and openness, and acting ethically. These values apply to the way managers and employees treat themselves among each other as well as to their contact with customers, business partners, and public authorities. Only by adhering to these values can long-term business relationships be established and maintained, conflicts be resolved openly, mistakes be rectified in a solution-oriented manner, and trust in leadership and reliable cooperation be ensured.</p>
    <p>We have everything we need to achieve our objectives: vehicles that will take your breath away and a team that is passionate about its work.</p>
