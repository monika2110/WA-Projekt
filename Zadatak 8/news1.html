			<h2>Looking back: Porsche in 2021</h2>
			<p class="description">The sports car manufacturer launched a whole host of products and projects over the past 12 months.</p>
			<p>Right at the start of the year, Porsche celebrated the 25th birthday of the roadster family by releasing an anniversary model: the special Boxster 25 Years edition. This was limited to just 1,250 examples worldwide and made several visual references to the design features of the Boxster concept car which itself heralded the success story of the open-top two-seater at the 1993 Detroit Motor Show. The production version of the Boxster was launched in 1996 with very few visual changes from the concept and is now in its fourth generation, with more than 357,000 examples having been built.</p>
			<p>The seventh edition of this high-performance sports car was developed in close collaboration with Porsche Motorsport. During the final tuning work, it made its way around the Nurburgring Nordschleife, traditionally the benchmark for all Porsche sports cars, more than 17 seconds faster than the previous model. Development driver Lars Kern needed just 6:59.927 minutes for a full 20.8-km lap."</p>
			<p>A summit meeting with a difference in the Swiss Alps: Porsche head designer Michael Mauer and skiing legend Aksel Lund Svindal set out in search of the perfect line, talking about courage, inspiration and passion. The associated film was featured at this year's Cannes Corporate Media & TV Awards among other film festivals.</p>
