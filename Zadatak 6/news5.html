		<h2>A battery's role in balancing range, performance and sustainability</h2>
		<p class="description">Porsche has a clear goal: by 2030, the sports car manufacturer plans to have a carbon-neutral balance sheet across its entire value chain.</p>
		<p>The company's timeline for changes to production and logistics has been updated accordingly, although it is the progress of electric mobility that will play the pivotal role.</p>
		<p>Almost half of all the CO2 emissions generated during the lifecycle of an electric vehicle are produced at the manufacturing stage, which includes the extraction and processing of raw materials. The second-largest source of emissions is operation of the vehicle, which is determined by the energy mix used to charge it, charging efficiency, vehicle efficiency and driving style. Recycling procedures and further processing of materials at the end of a vehicle's life cycle generate the lowest proportion of CO2 emissions.</p>
		<p>In terms of individual factors, the powertrain battery has the greatest influence on CO2 emissions during a vehicle's lifecycle: the battery accounts for around 40 per cent of the carbon dioxide produced when a single Taycan is manufactured. In other words, the size of the energy carrier is fundamentally responsible for the carbon footprint of an electric vehicle. Yet it is also this component that determines an electric vehicle's success on the market: after all, the size of the battery must be right to ensure that these vehicles meet customers' expectations and requirements.</p>
		<p>According to a study conducted by a vehicle manufacturer in the US, worries about being left stranded with an empty battery are the main barrier to customers buying an electric vehicle. An increase in battery capacity and efficiency mean that electric vehicles are evolving to better suit customer requirements. Some manufacturers are now in a position to launch models with a range of well over 600 kilometres, but smaller vehicles for shorter journeys and a smaller operating range are also becoming more popular.</p>
